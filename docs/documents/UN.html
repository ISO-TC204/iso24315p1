A regulation might be defined such that it is in effect between midnight (0:00) and 06:00 when snow is present. For an ADS to comply with this regulation, there must be an agreement on 1) the meaning of midnight (e.g., local time or UTC), identifying which entity (e.g., METR disseminator or ADS) is responsible for determining when the snow present condition is met, 3) whether the regulation applies to the ADS (e.g., does the regulation apply to police vehicles when responding to an emergency).

If a user is notified of a static rule for a lower speed limit &quot;when workers are present&quot;, it should be aware of whether it should expect to be electronically notified of workers being present and, if so, whether it can legally rely upon that notification.</td>

                      <td class="custom-col htmlContent">User systems rely upon wireless communication media that often have limited bandwidth. Processing and storing data increases hardware requirements. Preventing unnecessary the downloads allows a more efficient system; however, the need to obtain complete rule sets with proper accountability remains. To enhance the system efficiency, users should be able to subset rules based on: 
(1) the classification of the vehicle within the target jurisdiction (i.e., passenger vehicles do not need rules for commercial vehicles or sidewalk robots), 
(2) location and intent (e.g., a vehicle might wish to store all rules related to its home location but only to retrieve rules along a narrow corridor for a long trip),
(3) type of rule (e.g., some vehicles might not use parking rules in any way so it would be pointless to download them), 
(4) temporal constraints (lawyers and insurance companies might wish to discover rules that were in effect on a past date),
(5) other characteristics that might relate to special rules (e.g., emergency response, delivery, dangerous goods, permitted, heavy, and other vehicles might be subject to special regulations of which only they need to be aware).

The filtering parameters need to be standardized so that users can have condfidence that they are requesting all rules that are needed. For example, disseminators should allow a user to indicate a request for all rules for a standard profile, such as a passenger car.</td>
