            <h3>8.1.2 Refresh rule set</h3>
            <div class="htmlContent"><p>When Sandy starts her minivan, components on her minivan immediately go to work preparing for the journey. The ADS, driver support system, and METR receiver each begin various diagnostic checks. The METR receiver checks how old each of its previously downloaded rule sets are. The receiver must download any rule set that the receiver determines to be needed for the journey and is not currently downloaded or is nearing or past its expiration. The receiver may download other rule sets (e.g., to refresh rules early), but is not required to do so. Sandy's minivan only downloads rules sets that are relevant for its supported Level 4 ADS and driver support capabilities, which includes "general rules", "motor vehicle right-of-way", "motor vehicle parking", and "motor vehicle speed limits". Sandy can begin manually driving before the download is complete but some of the driver support features might be limited until the receiver completes the download. The Level 4 ADS will not operate until all rule sets are downloaded.</p><p>Sandy's minivan provides a large display on the center console where much of the driver support information is displayed. It includes a dedicated area that displays the current speed limit along with a larger area used for case-specific information, such as stop sign, traffic signal, and other information. If Sandy begins driving with recently expired rules, the minivan continues to display the old rules but they are displayed with a transparent effect to emphasize the reduced trust and if they are sufficiently old they are no longer displayed.&nbsp;</p></div>

            <h3>8.1.3 Snowy conditions</h3>
            <div class="htmlContent"><p>Local ordinances in Sandy’s locale specify that ADS are not permitted to operate during snowy conditions (partially due to an incident from years prior where several ADS-equipped vehicles behaved erratically during a snowstorm). The assessment of whether "snowy conditions" exist is determined by the local transportation operator. Due to current conditions this morning, the operator has temporarily activated the rule banning the operation of ADS due to the snowy conditions. This ban is automatically transmitted to all ADS-equipped vehicles within the jurisdiction as a part of the "wide area supplemental data set".</p><p>Due to the ban, the ADS is unable to engage and Sandy is required to assume all responsibility for the dynamic driving task,; however, she still has the assistance of the driver support system (including anti-lock brakes, automated emergency braking, etc).</p></div>

            <h3>8.1.4 Start of snowfall</h3>
            <div class="htmlContent"><p>Within this jurisdiction, a lower speed limit applies when raining. Unlike the ADS-ban, the lower speed limits take effect dynamically based on conditions rather than through a centralized manual assessment. As a result, to provide trustworthy information to the driver, the driver support system has to always be aware of whether it is raining or not and to be aware of what qualifies as "rain" within the jurisdiction (e.g., Does snow activate this rule? What rate of precipitation activates the rule?). All of this information is provided within the electronic representation of the rule as provided by METR.</p><p>Sandy's vehicle is equipped with sensors that can determine the rate and type of precipitation and provide this supplemental data to the METR receiver, which then compares the data with the rule information to determine the current legal speed limit. Today, the receiver determines that the current snowfall is legally considered to be "rain" and the receiver reports a lower speed limit to the driver support system, which displays the lower speed limit to Sandy. As the precipitation is first detected, the driver support system also chimes once to alert Sandy to the lower speed limit.&nbsp;</p><p>Other vehicles might detect rain conditions in other ways. For example, a vehicle might contact its OEM to obtain current weather conditions or another vehicle might base its logic on the state of the windshield wipers.</p></div>

            <h3>8.1.5 Operation of a traffic signal</h3>
            <div class="htmlContent"><p>The "motor vehicle right-of-way" rule set includes the location of traffic signals along the expected route and an indication of whether each of the signals support the provision of electronic intersection status information. By being aware of these locations and capabilities, the receiver knows where to expect to receive intersection status information, which is one type of supplemental data. The intersection status information provides indications of which manoeuvres have right-of-way in real time. As this supplemental data is received, it is conveyed to Sandy through the main display screen allowing her to see the current permissions even when the view of the signal head is blocked by another vehicle or obscured due to sunlight. Further, because the vehicle can determine its own location and it has the location of known traffic signals, the receiver will be able to detect instances when expected intersection status information is missing. In this case, it will be able to warn Sandy of abnormal conditions and to be extra cautious.</p></div>

            <div class="htmlContent"><p>As Sandy reaches her destination to meet her child, she searches for an appropriate parking spot. As her son has disabilities, she has an accessible parking permit that has been electronically registered with the METR receiver on her minivan. The driver support system is also aware that the minivan's accessible door is on the right side of the van. As a result, as she enters the parking lot, the driver support system on her minivan guides her to the area of the lot with accessible parking spaces and highlights spots that have accessibility aisles on the right side of the parking space.</p></div>

            <h3>8.2.2 Download rule set for long journey</h3>
            <div class="htmlContent"><p>Based on the information contained on her calendar, Ms. Hood's virtual assistant alerts the METR receiver on-board her car that a trip is planned for the following day. Because it was notified a day in advance, the METR receiver has the flexibility to retrieve the rule set for the trip using Ms. Hood's preferred connectivity option, which is her home Wi-Fi connection. The connection becomes available the evening before the trip and all of the relevant rules that are expected to be needed for the journey are retrieved. This includes retrieving rule sets for different national jurisdictions.</p><p>The next morning, Ms. Hood gets into her vehicle and confirms that she wishes to travel to her grandma's house and that she wants to engage the ADS mode. The ADS informs her that the trip includes a segment at the end that is outside of the ADS's ODD and that she will have to agree to accept manual control for this portion of the journey. As she agrees to this condition, the ADS is already checking other aspects of her journey to ensure everything is in order.</p></div>

            <h3>8.2.4 Encountering a new traffic control device</h3>
            <div class="htmlContent"><p>As the vehicle proceeds through the work zone, it approaches the site of a new stop sign associated with a new side street. Even though the sign was installed minutes before, Ms. Hood's vehicle was already aware of the new sign location.&nbsp;</p><p>Stop signs are included in the pre-announced "motor vehicle right-of-way" rule set that Ms. Hood's vehicle retrieved the evening before. The rule set included an announcement of an "inactive" stop sign at this location with a flag indicating that it was planned for installation. This information had been entered the &nbsp;previous week and although the sign had originally been scheduled to be installed yesterday, the field crew did not install it until this morning.</p><p>When the field crew installed the sign, they also activated a roadside beacon that continually broadcasts supplemental data indicating that the stop sign is now active. They also notified the appropriate translator and had them change the pre-announced rule to indicate that the sign was now active. The crew will come back in roughly a week (after all previously distributed "motor vehicle right-of-way" rule sets have expired) to retrieve the temporary roadside beacon.&nbsp;</p><p>In the case of Ms. Hood, her vehicle downloaded the rule set the prior evening, when the rule for the new stop sign was known but before it was activated; as a result, the vehicle was aware that a sign might be encountered but would proceed as normal unless it received an update. As Ms. Hood's vehicle approaches the site of the sign, it receives the broadcast from the temporary beacon activating the sign and the Level 4 ADS stops without causing Ms. Hood to spill her coffee.&nbsp;</p><p>This approach ensures that the electronic rules stay synchronized with field conditions, even when traffic control devices are not installed according to original schedule.&nbsp;</p><p>NOTE: The same process can be followed for the installation or removal of any traffic control device.</p></div>

            <div class="htmlContent"><p>As Ms. Hood's vehicle gets onto the motorway, it encounters a section of road managed with a variable speed limit system. The location of the variable speed limit system was included in the pre-announced "motor vehicle speed limit" rule set retrieved the previous evening. The ADS had also checked the speed limit as it started the trip (for trip navigation purposes) but as this is a variable speed limit system, the exact speed limit is not known for certain until the driver enters the subject road section.&nbsp;</p><p>As the ADS approaches the location of the variable speed limit system, the METR receiver expects to receive a broadcast of the current speed limit. If the broadcasted supplemental data is not received, the METR receiver might try to connect to the disseminator to retrieve the information and if that fails, the ADS might be required to disengage.</p><p>In this case, the broadcasted supplemental data is received and the METR receiver provides the information to the ADS without Ms. Hood having to get involved. Ms. Hood continues comfortably towards her grandmother's house.</p></div>

            <h3>8.2.6 Snow chain requirements</h3>
            <div class="htmlContent"><p>As Ms. Hood begins to cross the mountain pass, the weather takes a turn for the worse and snow begins to accumulate on the roadway. Shortly afterwards, the METR receiver receives a notification that snow chain regulations have been activated. This rule indicates that there is a 30-minute grace period prior to the rule being enforced, which is designed to allow drivers to safely stop and put chains on at designated areas.</p><p>Ms. Hood's ADS is advanced enough to be allowed to drive under such conditions, but the vehicle is still required to use chains. The ADS alerts Ms. Hood of the recently activated rule and informs her that it will stop at the next safety spot to allow her to install the chains.&nbsp;</p><p>Luckily, Ms. Hood always keeps snow chains in the car. When the car stops, she gets out and installs the chains and uses the vehicle's interactive display to confirm that the chains are properly attached to the tires. Once Ms. Hood is resettled into her snug cabin, the ADS continues on its way, verifying that the tire sensors detect traction and vibrations that are consistent with having snow chains on the wheels.</p></div>

Ms. Hood is faced with two options:</p><ol><li>Have someone bring an updated set of rules to the vehicle and transfer them (e.g., from a smartphone to the vehicle) or</li><li>Manually drive the vehicle to an area with internet connectivity and download the rules.</li></ol><p>Since Ms. Hood's vehicle supports manual drive mode, she opts to driver herself to an area with internet connectivity rather than waiting for someone to assist her. During this portion of the trip, the vehicle's driver support system is more limited than normal since its rules are out-of-date and what information is displayed is clearly marked as being of questionable trustworthiness. Nonetheless, many driver support features still work (e.g., anti-lock brakes) and Ms. Hood can still arrive without undue burden.</p><p>Once she has received updated pre-announced rules, the ADS is allowed to re-engage and Ms. Hood returns home safely.</p></div>
