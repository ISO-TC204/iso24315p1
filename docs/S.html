            <h3>8.2.2 Refresh rule set</h3>
            <div class="htmlContent"><p>When Sandy starts her minivan, components on her minivan immediately go to work preparing for the journey. The ADS, driver information system, and METR receiver each begin various diagnostic checks. The METR receiver checks how old each of its previously downloaded rule sets are and discovers that several have expired. The receiver downloads the rule sets necessary for the journey that are not currently downloaded or that are nearing or past their expiration. The receiver may download other rule sets (e.g., to refresh rules early), but is not required to do so. Sandy's minivan only downloads rule sets that are relevant for its supported Level 4 ADS and driver support capabilities, which includes "general rules", "motor-vehicle road geometry", "motor vehicle right-of-way", "motor vehicle parking", and "motor vehicle speed limits". Sandy's ADS can have confidence in the data contained in the rules because the translator, collector, and disseminator are all required to adhere to strict data access policies within their systems and all rules are signed by each of these entities and exchanged over encrypted links.</p><p>Sandy can begin manually driving before the download is complete but some of the driver support features might be limited until the receiver completes the download. The Level 4 ADS will not operate until all necessary rule sets are downloaded for the vehicle's current location and immediate vicinity.</p><p>Sandy's minivan provides a large display on the center console where much of the driver information is displayed. It includes a dedicated area that displays the current speed limit along with a larger area used for case-specific information, such as stop sign, traffic signal, and other information. If Sandy begins driving with recently expired rules, the minivan continues to display the old rules, but they are displayed with a transparent effect to emphasize the reduced trust and if they are sufficiently old they are no longer displayed.&nbsp;</p></div>

            <h3>8.2.3 Snowy conditions</h3>
            <div class="htmlContent"><p>Local ordinances in Sandy’s locale specify that ADS are not permitted to operate during snowy conditions (partially due to an incident from years prior where several ADS-equipped vehicles behaved erratically during a snowstorm). The ordinance is written such that the assessment of whether "snowy conditions" exist is determined by the local transportation operator. Due to current conditions this morning, the operator has temporarily activated the rule banning the operation of ADS due to the snowy conditions. This ban is automatically transmitted to all ADS-equipped vehicles within the jurisdiction as a part of the "wide area supplemental data set".</p><p>Due to the ban, the ADS is unable to engage, and Sandy is required to assume all responsibility for the dynamic driving task; however, she still has the assistance of the driver information system (including anti-lock brakes, automated emergency braking, etc).</p></div>

            <h3>8.2.4 Start of snowfall</h3>
            <div class="htmlContent"><p>Within this jurisdiction, a lower speed limit applies when raining. Unlike the ADS-ban, the lower speed limits take effect dynamically based on conditions rather than through a centralized manual assessment. As a result, to provide trustworthy information to the driver, the driver support system has to always be aware of whether it is raining or not and to be aware of what qualifies as "rain" within the jurisdiction (e.g., Does snow activate this rule? What rate of precipitation activates the rule?). All this information is provided within the electronic representation of the rule as provided by METR.</p><p>Sandy's vehicle is equipped with sensors that can determine the rate and type of precipitation and provide this supplemental data to the METR receiver, which then compares the data with the rule information to determine the current legal speed limit. Today, the receiver determines that the current snowfall is legally considered to be "rain" and the receiver reports a lower speed limit to the driver information system, which displays the lower speed limit to Sandy. As the precipitation is first detected, the driver information system also chimes once to alert Sandy to the lower speed limit.&nbsp;</p><p>Other vehicles might detect rain conditions in other ways. For example, a vehicle might contact its OEM to obtain current weather conditions, or another vehicle might base its logic on the state of the windshield wipers. The acceptable forms of supplemental data are specified within the electronic rule as determined by the regulator and translator.</p></div>

            <h3>8.2.5 Operation of a traffic signal</h3>
            <div class="htmlContent"><p>The "motor vehicle right-of-way" rule set includes the location of traffic signals along the expected route and an indication of whether each of the signals support the provision of electronic intersection status information. By being aware of these locations and capabilities, the receiver knows where to expect to receive intersection status information, which is one type of supplemental data. The intersection status information provides indications of which manoeuvres have right-of-way in real time. As this supplemental data is received, it is conveyed to Sandy through the main display screen allowing her to see the current permissions even when the view of the signal head is blocked by another vehicle or obscured due to sunlight. Further, because the vehicle can determine its own location and it has the location of known traffic signals, the receiver will be able to detect instances when expected intersection status information is missing. In this case, it will be able to warn Sandy of abnormal conditions and to be extra cautious.</p></div>

As her son has disabilities, she has an accessible parking permit that has been electronically registered with the METR receiver on her minivan. The driver information system is also aware that the minivan's accessible door is on the right side of the van. As a result, as she enters the parking lot, the driver support system on her minivan guides her to the area of the lot with accessible parking spaces and highlights spots that have accessibility aisles on the right side of the parking space.</p></div>

            <h3>8.3.2 Download rule set for long journey</h3>
            <div class="htmlContent"><p>Based on the information contained on her calendar, Ms. Hood's virtual assistant alerts her car that a trip to her grandmother's house is planned for the following day. Due to some previous encounters with unseemly characters, Ms. Hood is very concerned about her privacy and keeping her information confidential. Protecting her information requires all components with access to her information adhere to strict security practices and Ms. Hood is aware that this is a built-in aspect of the METR components. For example, the METR interface is encrypted to ensure confidentiality while the data is in motion and the disseminator does not store her requests nor the details about what information it supplies to Ms. Hood's vehicle, nor does it use this information for any other purpose. Likewise, her vehicle implements strict access controls on the data it stores. All of these policies prevent unauthorized data access.</p><p>This level of security allows the vehicle's on-board computer to notify the METR receiver of Ms. Hood's planned trip. Because it was notified a day in advance, the METR receiver has the flexibility to retrieve the rule set for the trip using Ms. Hood's preferred connectivity option, which is her home Wi-Fi connection. The connection becomes available the evening before the trip and all the relevant rules that are expected to be needed for the journey are retrieved. This includes retrieving rule sets for different national jurisdictions.</p><p>The next morning, Ms. Hood gets into her vehicle and confirms that she wishes to travel to her grandma's house and that she wants to engage the ADS mode.

This information had been entered the previous week and although the sign had originally been scheduled to be installed yesterday, the field crew did not install it until this morning.</p><p>When the field crew installed the sign, they also activated a roadside beacon that continually broadcasts supplemental data indicating that the stop sign is now active. They also notified the appropriate translator and had them change the pre-announced rule to indicate that the sign was now active. The crew will come back in roughly a week (after all previously distributed "motor vehicle right-of-way" rule sets have expired) to retrieve the temporary roadside beacon.&nbsp;</p><p>In the case of Ms. Hood, her vehicle downloaded the rule set the prior evening, when the rule for the new stop sign was known but before it was activated; as a result, the vehicle was aware that a sign might be encountered but would proceed as normal unless it received an update. As Ms. Hood's vehicle approaches the site of the sign, it receives the broadcast from the temporary beacon activating the sign and the Level 4 ADS stops without causing Ms. Hood to spill her coffee.&nbsp;</p><p>This approach ensures that the electronic rules stay synchronized with field conditions, even when traffic control devices are not installed according to original schedule.&nbsp;</p><p>NOTE: The same process can be followed for the installation or removal of any traffic control device.</p></div>

            <div class="htmlContent"><p>As Ms. Hood begins to cross the mountain pass, the weather takes a turn for the worse and snow begins to accumulate on the roadway. Shortly afterwards, the METR receiver receives a notification that snow chain regulations have been activated. This rule indicates that there is a 30-minute grace period prior to the rule being enforced, which is designed to allow drivers to safely stop and put chains on at designated areas.</p><p>Ms. Hood's ADS is advanced enough to be allowed to drive under such conditions, but the vehicle is still required to use chains. The ADS alerts Ms. Hood of the recently activated rule and informs her that it will stop at the next safety spot to allow her to install the chains.&nbsp;</p><p>Luckily, Ms. Hood always keeps snow chains in the car. When the car stops, she gets out and installs the chains and uses the vehicle's interactive display to confirm that the chains are properly attached to the tires. Once Ms. Hood is resettled into her snug cabin, the ADS continues on its way, verifying that the tire sensors detect traction and vibrations that are consistent with having snow chains on the wheels.</p></div>

            <div class="htmlContent"><p>Klaus drives a container-carrying commercial vehicle that includes a level-4 ADS. The operational design domain (ODD) for the truck includes most motorways and dual carriageways, but few single carriageways. Thus, the ADS controls the truck over long haul (inter-urban) routes, but Klaus typically takes over once the truck leaves major inter-urban facilities. The ADS requires the following electronic rule sets to engage: "general rules", "motor-vehicle road geometry", "motor vehicle right-of-way", "motor vehicle speed limits", and "regulated vehicle". In addition, when carrying dangerous goods, it must have the "dangerous goods" rule set.</p></div>

            <h3>8.4.2 Download rules</h3>
            <div class="htmlContent"><p>While Klaus's truck is being loaded with the next delivery, the delivery addresses are electronically provided to his navigation system. &nbsp;The navigation system, in cooperation with an external service, computes several viable routes to provide all the deliveries while complying with corporate rules (e.g., avoiding cross-traffic turns). &nbsp;The navigation system then requests the METR receiver to report on the availability of its required rule sets for each of the routes developed. Some of the routes include sections that do not yet have all of the required rules in electronic form. The navigation system displays the various routes for Klaus, ordered based on overall efficiency which balances the desire to minimize total trip time while maximizing the percent of time spent with the ADS engaged. Once Klaus selects the route selection, the navigator requests the METR receiver to retrieve the rule sets for the entire route, contacting multiple disseminators, if necessary. The scope of rules requested include both the ADS-controlled parts as well as the sections for which Klaus will be responsible.</p><p>When the ADS is in control, it is equipped with sufficient operational autonomy to deviate from its pre-defined route when necessary to avoid breaking any rules. If the ADS detects options (e.g., among two alternate paths), it may prompt Klaus for input, providing him with alternatives such as a longer fully automated route vs. a shorter route that has sections where Klaus must drive. In some cases (e.g., if the vehicle reverts to the fallback mode), Klaus will be alerted, and he is always allowed to take over control.&nbsp;</p><p>When Klaus is in control, an on-board display shares relevant rules when Klaus is near an area where a rule might apply. It automatically notifies him if he seems headed for a road where his truck is not permitted, warns him of speed and lane restrictions and violations automatically. If Klaus deviates from a predicted route, the on-board electronics ask for any new relevant rules from the appropriate disseminator.</p></div>

In the meantime, the interpreter informs the HMI that rule information is not available and the HMI warns Klaus of this fact; for the interim, Klaus will have to rely on physical traffic control devices. Eventually, the METR receiver obtains the necessary rules and the interpreter updates the HMI so that the warning is removed and rules are once again available through the main display - along with warnings, if and when Klaus violates any rules. Klaus continues to follow signage on the sign and he ends up on the town's ring road; eventually he rejoins the remainder of the detoured traffic on the other side of town at the end of the detour.&nbsp;</p><p>As the detour ends, Klaus re-engages the ADS, as it is no longer banned.</p></div>

While international agreements and electronic technologies have made crossing this border almost seamless, there are changes in laws that impact how his METR receiver and ADS operate. In particular, the METR receiver works with other vehicle systems to address these changes, including:</p><ul><li>The speed limit is now conveyed in miles per hour rather than kilometers per hour</li><li>The definition of a dangerous goods vehicle has changed</li><li>The distinction between urban and rural roads have changed</li><li>The rules on when an ADS can operate a hazardous goods vehicle have changed</li><li>The ADS is required to be certified by the national government to operate within the country</li><li>Stop signs require a 2-second full stop</li></ul><p>From Klaus's perspective, when the ADS is operating nothing seems to change. When Klaus is in control of the vehicle, he may occasionally see warning messages that he would have not seen before (e.g., a warning that he did not stop long enough at the stop sign).</p></div>

            <h3>8.5.3 Rental car</h3>
            <div class="htmlContent"><p>In addition to the rules that all other cars retrieve, the rental car also needs to be aware of additional rules (e.g., prohibition against driving on unpaved roads, limits within which the vehicle is allowed to operate) specific to the rental car company's vehicle fleet. While these rules could be provided by other means, the rental car company determined that this was the appropriate way to convey its rules to its vehicle fleet. While Bilo agrees to these rules as a part of the rental contract, the ADS navigation logic needs to be aware of the rules to ensure that they are not violated. As a result, the rental car company authorized its vehicle fleet manager as a regulator to establish these rules and provides its own METR distribution system to provide these rules to its vehicle fleet. Once the vehicle fleet manager decides upon a rule, it is entered by one of its two employees that are authorized to do so (i.e., "agents").&nbsp;</p><p>The rental car company also manages various car rental locations, each with their own parking lots with rules (e.g., one-way aisles/lanes, stop signs at exit points, restricted access) established by the local property manager. The local property manager is a regulator with the authority to establish these types of campus rules. Since non-fleet vehicles may also access the parking area for dropping off customers, campus rules that might be relevant to non-fleet vehicles are distributed using the main METR distribution system used for all other jurisdictional rules. Since these rules are enforced by a private entity (e.g., the rental car company itself with the aid of a tow truck operator), the rules do not have to be approved by any higher jurisdictional entity. The campus regulator may also choose to establish rules to restricted sections of its campus that are only distributed to the vehicle fleet via the campus's own METR distribution system.</p></div>

            <div class="htmlContent"><p>The first stop on Bilo's trip is the university campus. The university covers multiple square kilometres and has a road network separate from the city transport system. All the transport rules on the campus are governed by the university rather than by the city, except for University Avenue, a city street that traverses the campus. In particular, the default speed limit on the campus streets is lower than in the city due to the high number of pedestrians. The university's transport division is responsible for defining these rules and is registered with the local government as the provider of rules for the campus based on a letter of authorization from the campus owner. However, because the university relies upon city police to issue tickets, all its rules must be approved by the city prior to being enforced due to a clause in the contract with city police.</p><p>The METR receiver in Bilo's vehicle is aware of Bilo's destination and requests rules from all of the necessary jurisdictions, including the national, regional, and city governments along with the private campuses encountered, such as the university.</p><p>As Bilo enters the university campus, the ADS is aware that the jurisdiction has changed but is also aware that it is still on University Avenue and subject to the rules of the city. As the vehicle turns onto a campus street, it recognizes that the campus speed limits and other rules apply.</p></div>

            <h3>8.5.5 Rule discrepancy</h3>
            <div class="htmlContent"><p>Suddenly, Bilo's ADS detects an inconsistency. METR indicates that the road uses the lower university default speed limit, but the vehicle's video imaging system detects a speed limit sign with a slightly higher speed. The interpreter considers that the METR speed limit has not been verified for a couple of years, that it is signed by a less trustworthy source (i.e., a university rather than a large city), and that crowdsourced information started reporting an inconsistency a day earlier; it also notes that its video imaging system reported a high confidence on its reading of the sign. While the interpreter concludes that its video imaging system has more reliable data, it determines that it is safer to follow the lower speed limit and reports this lower speed limit to the ADS. The interpreter also notifies the discrepancy reporter, which then notifies the report handler at a randomized time after it reaches stable WiFi coverage (i.e., the delayed notification increases privacy by preventing the data from being used to identify its location at a point in time).&nbsp;</p><p>When the report handler receives frequent notices of a discrepancy (based on street volumes), it provides an anonymized report to the rule verifier to investigate the discrepancy. It turns out that the university posted a new speed limit sign but did not yet enter the information into METR. The rule verifier notifies the university and the traffic division received a bit of a slap on the wrist for failing to follow its defined procedures. Nonetheless, the discrepancy feedback mechanism allowed the inaccuracy to be corrected within 72 hours.</p></div>

            <h3>8.5.6 Permitted parking</h3>
            <div class="htmlContent"><p>The large university campus requires visitors to have parking passes. During the trip to the university, the ADS identifies its preferred parking spot and interfaces with the METR receiver to obtain the rules for using the parking facility. The ADS then informs Bilo that he will be required to register and pay for a temporary permit to park on campus. Since Bilo is not driving, he fills out the necessary forms using the on-board computer and pays the associated fee. Once payment is confirmed and Bilo's visit is approved, the electronic permit is downloaded to the on-board computer and the on-board computer notifies both the ADS and the METR receiver of the newly received permit. The METR receiver then downloads additional rules for operating inside of the parking lot based on presenting the new certificate.</p><p>As the vehicle reaches the parking lot, it discovers it is controlled by a gate. The on-board computer presents its permit electronically to the gate controller and is granted access without interfering with the METR receiver.</p><p>As the vehicle enters the parking lot for which it has a permit, the ADS continues to control the vehicle, but in this case, the prevailing limiting speed limit is one defined by the vehicle's OEM. Although the university parking lot has a speed limit of 25 kph, the ADS is equipped with internal logic that limits its speed in parking lots to 20 kph. The METR receiver is constantly integrating all the rules it has (e.g., from national, regional, local, campus, fleet, OEM) and provides the resultant rules (i.e., typically the most restrictive rules) to the ADS, which applies them in its performance of the DDT.</p></div>

The ride-sourcing service also provides an electronic copy of Fiona's permit to the driver with a timestamp so that the driver has evidence that he is authorized to access the restricted passenger loading location. In this case, the closest passenger loading location is co-located with a bus stop.</p></div>

Additional rules inform her that she is not allowed to operate on the sidewalk on the other side of the street either – the local regulator determined that the foot traffic in the area was high enough that the single sidewalk on the street should be limited to human users. And due to her small engine, Rosie is not allowed to operate in the travel lanes of the street.

He is also alerted several times along the trip with ad-hoc rules that have been established by the police to warn of specific high-water areas. Some of these are broadcast through the use of localized beacons while others are announced a wide-area signal where coverage is available.</p><p>As he travels, the interpreter on-board Thibideaux's vehicle compares the METR rules against what is reported by its cameras. The interpreter of the rules is aware that the area has recently experienced a hurricane and when inconsistencies between METR rules and physical traffic control devices (e.g., mainly due to missing signs coupled with a few temporary detour signs placed by police), it notifies its discrepancy reporter.&nbsp;</p><p>Intermittently, Thibideaux's pickup enters into cellular coverage. Due to the number of discrepancy reports that it is holding, the discrepancy reporter decides to immediately upload the discrepancy reports to the report handler. As the report handler receives multiple reports from independent sources, it notifies the verifier of the reported discrepancies. Normally, the report handler and the verifier would flag the number of distinct discrepancies at different locations as suspect, but because they are aware of the recent hurricane, they accept that these might be real reports worthy of investigation. Within a couple of hours of the storm passing through, the agency is aware of virtually all potentially missing signs in the region due to various drivers reporting discrepancies; unfortunately, the shear volume of missing signs means that it will be a while before they are all investigated and replaced. To minimize the volume of discrepancy reports exchanged, the verifier notifies the translator to issue a notice for each discrepancy reported and to indicate that it is being investigated. At this point, the notices include an indication that interpreters should make their own best judgement of which source to believe (i.e., as the reports are not yet verified, it is inappropriate for the verifier to provide guidance).&nbsp;</p><p>As the verifier investigates each inconsistency, it directs the translator to update its data, for example to:</p><ol><li>Update the notice to indicate that the METR rule should take precedence (e.g., for a missing sign),</li><li>Replace the notice with a new temporary rule (e.g., to reflect a temporary sign deployed by police),</li><li>Update the notice to advise METR users to ignore the traffic control device (e.g., a sign that has been bent such that it is visible to unintended vehicles).</li></ol><p>With this information interpreters are better able to ensure that they provide METR users with trustworthy information in a timely manner.&nbsp;</p></div>

            <div class="htmlContent"><p>The METR receiver is aware of where traffic signals are located and where the vehicle should receive supplemental data with real-time traffic signal timing information. However, as Thibideaux approaches one of the recorded traffic signal locations, no such data is received. The driver information system warns Thibideaux that the signal is not transmitting electronic information as it should be and that he should be extra cautious; it also reminds him of the rule that requires him to treat the intersection as being under a four-way stop sign control when the signal is not displaying any indications. &nbsp;</p><p>Thibideaux realizes that the traffic signal is without power and is not showing any indications. He treats the signal as a four-way stop and proceeds.</p></div>

            <h3>8.9.2 Defence</h3>
            <div class="htmlContent"><p>One of the main pieces of evidence that Larry relies upon is the records that are maintained by the on-board ADS, the METR receiver, and the METR disseminator. Each of these system components record what information it received and made available. Further, each component strictly controls data access to prevents users from inappropriately modifying their logs.</p><p>From these records, Larry can demonstrate that the disseminator was publishing the pre-announced rules of a higher speed limit and that the METR receiver and ADS relied upon this information. He can further show that the rules were initially signed by the translator, in this case the city transport department, and then sent to the collector and disseminator prior to their distribution to his client's vehicle.</p></div>
