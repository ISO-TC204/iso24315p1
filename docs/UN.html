User systems need an accurate representation of rules at every point in time (e.g., on the scale of 0.1 second resolution) to make appropriate dynamic driving task (DDT) decisions. Since the bulk of rules are relatively static, it would be very inefficient to download all defined rules 10 times a second; instead, the METR ConOps divides rules into two basic types: rules that are relatively static are defined as "expected" and rules that can change with little notice are defined as "unexpected". The distinction between these two categories is based on whether the changed rule becomes active prior to the expiration of its relevant rule set.</p></td>
