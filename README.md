## Management of Electronic Surface Transport Regulations â€“ Part 1: Concept of Operations

[Upcoming Workshops](https://iso-tc204.github.io/iso24315p1/index.html#Workshops)

This site is dedicated to the development of ISO 24315 Part 1, which is the Concept of Operations for the Management of Electronic Surface Transport Regulations and other official notices.

Surface transport regulations include all of the rules related to using the surface transport infrastruture. This includes:

- Virtually all types of notices, including rules:
	- Published in the vehicle code
	- Posted with signs 
	- Marked on the roadway/pavement
- Virtually all modes of travel, including rules for:
	- Motor vehicles (i.e., self-propelled road vehicles)
	- Non-motorized road vehicles (e.g., horse and buggy)
	- Vehicles that do not normally mix with motor vehicles (e.g., pedalcycles, sidewalk delivery robots)
	- Pedestrians
- Virually all surface transport facilities, including rules for the use of:
	- Roads
	- Auxiliary lanes (e.g., cycle lanes)
	- Sidewalks 
	- Pedestrian plazas
	- Indoor environments

As driving automation systems become more common, the importance of providing trustworthy rules of the road to the public has become more critical. 

At a very basic level, consider a navigation system that displays the speed limit to the driver. Most current generation systems rely upon GNSS information from the navigation unit coupled with a database of speed limits to display the current sped limit to the driver. But this can result in inaccurate information as the data in the database ages (e.g., especially in the case of temporary road work speed limits). For a human driver, this is an annoyance that could result in the driver being liable for vioating what is actually posted in the field - but for a fully automated vehicle (i.e., an ADS-equipped vehicle), it can be especially problematic.

The ISO 24315 series aims to address this issue by providing all of the rules of the road to user systems in a trustworthy manner.

This site is one of the ways that ISO/TC 204/WG 19 intends to provide information to and gain feedback from stakeholders. To see the primary site for the latest updates, visit our [main page](https://iso-tc204.github.io/iso24315p1/).
